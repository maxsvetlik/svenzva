Svenzva's Revel Gripper action interface

Opening and closing are performed at fixed torque rates.
The 'target_current' value in the action goal is only used in the event that
'target_action' is 'close'. In which case, after the fingers are touching the target object,
the 'target_current' torque value is applied.
